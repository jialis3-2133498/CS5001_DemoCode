# Write a program that takes a series of numbers as

# those numbers that are perfect squares (i.e.
# the product of an integer with itself).

# Use "filter". You may define any helper functions
# you need separately or use a lambda expression. If
# you succeed using one approach, see if you can
# solve it using the other approach also.

# Example usage:
# $ python 05_ex_only_squares.py 10 5 16 36 8 4 9
# $ [16, 36, 4, 9]
